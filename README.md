# Analyzing-Shopping-Trends
Customer purchasing behavior data was downloaded from Kaggle and analyzed using Python. This is the result of the work of 4 other students and myself for the first Python class in our business analytics master's degree. 

To run the code, download the data file i have uploaded 'shopping_trends.csv' and adapt the Database Path code to reflect the path where the data file is located on your computer.

This analysis provides insightful observations into customer behavior and preferences across various demographics and regions. The customer distribution data reveals Montana, California, and Idaho as the leading states in customer count, with Rhode Island, Kansas, and Hawaii being the lowest. Gender analysis indicates comparable review ratings and spending between genders, though females purchase more frequently than males. Distinct item preferences were observed, with females favoring blouses, sandals, and shirts, and males opting for pants, jewelry, and coats. Regional fashion trends show significant variation, highlighting diverse style preferences, while promo code usage remains uniformly distributed across regions. Seasonal trends suggest higher spending during fall and winter, and age-based analysis reveals customers aged 58-70 as the most active purchasers, with notable regional differences in the 48-57 age bracket and uniform preferences within the 18-27 group.
